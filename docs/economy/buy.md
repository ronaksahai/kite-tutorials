import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Heading from '@theme/Heading';



This heading is outside the tabs, so it will correctly appear in the "On this page" sidebar.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple" attributes={{className: "redtab"}} default>
    <Heading as="h3">Gala Apples</Heading>
    This heading is inside a tab and uses the `<Heading>` component, so it **will not** appear in the sidebar. This is the correct way to do it.

    Gala apples are sweet and mild.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">

    Navel oranges are easy to peel.
  </TabItem>
