Before starting with command-building process :  
You need to make two variables from your **[Kite Dashboard](https://kite.onl/) > Stored Variables** 
- `economy` - this will handle your users data ( rank & balance )
- `shop` - this will handle your shop items' data
:::
:::note Do the variables need to be scoped ?
**A.** *If you're using the economy system in only one server* - **NO**  
**B.** *If you're using the economy system in multiple servers* - **YES**  
> In case **B** you'll have to use the scope `{{guild.id}}` with your variables.
